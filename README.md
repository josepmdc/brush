# Inertia
Inertia is a simple yet beautiful zsh prompt theme with git integration.

NOTE: Colors may look different depending on the colors set for your terminal. If you want it too look exacly like the one in the picture you can check my Alacritty config [here.](https://github.com/josepmdc/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml)

### How to install

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/josepmdc/inertia.git $HOME/dev/inertia \
  ln -s "$HOME/dev/inertia/inertia.zsh-theme" "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/inertia.zsh-theme"
```

This will clone the repo in ```$HOME/dev```, since it's where I like it, but if you want to have it somewhere else you can change it.

### Customization

You can customize this theme by editing the zsh-theme file and changing the colors or whatever you would like to change.
