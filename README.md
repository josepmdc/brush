# Inertia
Inertia is a simple yet beautiful zsh prompt theme with git integration.

NOTE: Colors may look different depending on the colors set for your terminal. If you want it too look exacly like the one in the picture you can check my Alacritty config [here.](https://github.com/josepmdc/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml)

You can customize it by editing the zsh-theme file. It's pretty straight forward.
